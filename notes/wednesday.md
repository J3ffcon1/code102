Remotes

What is a remote?

look at current remotes: git remote -v

git push origin (remote your pushing to is origin)

git remote add upstream https://github.com/codefellowspdx/code102.git
(command)     (convention)

now we have two get remotes for origin and then two git remotes for upstream.
check your remotes with git remote -v
git fetch upstream will take branches from upstream url.

git checkout -b name Allows you to create a branch. (name your branch Wednesday).
