Remotes

What is a remote?

look at current remotes: git remote -v

git push origin (remote your pushing to is origin)

git remote add upstream https://github.com/codefellowspdx/code102.git
(command)     (convention)

now we have two get remotes for origin and then two git remotes for upstream.
check your remotes with git remote -v
git fetch upstream will take branches from upstream url.

git checkout -b name Allows you to create a branch. (name your branch Wednesday).

While vs for loops
For loops are great for doing the same task over and over when you know how many times you repeat

while loops are when you have to loop but don't know how many times you need to loop.
 (however with while loops you can stop the loop with a counter variable, so it isn't infinitely looping)


for loops
   (start)     (end)      (increments)
(var i = 0; i < text.length; i++)

Arrays
myFirstString[myFirstString - 1] =  equals last character

semicolons and code block

camel-case
myName (like humps on a camel, the capital is further in)

this_is_snake_case

kabob-case
